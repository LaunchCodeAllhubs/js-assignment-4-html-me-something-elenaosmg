            </a>                            

               <p>The book details how a child's brain is formed, reveals the secrets of child's emotional sphere development and 
                  social relationships evolution. It gives the reader understanding of kids ability to think and make meaningful 
                  decisions and tells how to deal with specific challenges and how to balance parenting tasks with

            </a>                            

               <p>The book is based on the scientific theory of attachment. It shows how dependence and helplessness of a baby 
                  turns into maturity, how our love and care year after year form a secret support for a child personality. Explaining  
                  what really stands behind children's "whims", "spoiledness", "aggression", "bad character", the book prompts on how
                  to help kids grow and develop without wasting energy on fighting for parents love.</p>

            </a>                            

               <p>As a foreignor I found this book very helpfull in understanding how to enreach kids journey in American school and make it
                  more profound. The details on what and when children should be studying and the kind of work they should be doing together with 
                  essential reading lists makes it easier to judge if the quality of education the child gets meets the standarts set in a book.

            </a>                            

               <p> You learn from this book how uncertain our kids are and how much it is when parents know how to asure kids in their 
                  capability and be realistic in expectations, how to cultivate responsibility in our kids and what hurts kids most of all. 
                  It gives lots of practical advice to parents on how to respond when child is scared, nagging, rude, or 
                  accident-prone and this book also helps parents understand their own feelings and emotions and teaches remembering of taking care of 
                  ourselves.
